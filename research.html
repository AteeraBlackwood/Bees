      <h1>More Info</h1>
        <p>Worker bees live about six weeks in summer and several months in the winter. Colonies produce new worker bees continuously during the spring and summer, and then reproduction slows during the winter in response to the cold weather. A bee hive or colony will  decline by 5-10 percent during the winter, and replace the lost bees in the spring. In a bad year, a bee colony might lose 15-20 percent of its bees.</p>
        <p>However, according to Greenpeace.org, in the U.S., winter losses have commonly reached 30-50 percent, an amount thatâ€™s unsustainable for a hive population. U.S. National Agricultural Statistics show a honey bee decline from about 6 million hives in 1947 to 2.4 million hives in 2008, a 60 percent reduction.</p>
        <p>The number of working bee colonies per hectare provides a critical metric of crop health. In the U.S. the number of bee colonies per hectare has declined by 90 percent since 1962. </p>
      <h2>Large Scale Solutions</h2>
        <p>Protect pollinator health by preserving wild habitat.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Many of the hives and food sources of wild bees are destroyed by the human land development and agriculture.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Restore ecological agriculture.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ecological farming resists insect damage by avoiding large monocrops and preserving ecosystem diversity. Ecological farming restores soil nutrients with natural composting systems, avoids soil loss from wind and water erosion, and avoids pesticides and chemical fertilizers.
</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ban the seven most dangerous pesticides.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pesticides like nicotine-based clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiametoxam, clorpyriphos, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and fipronil wreak havoc on insect nervous systems and are commonly used in agriculture. These chemicals accumulate in bees and weaken them, increasing die-off.</li>
        </ul>
